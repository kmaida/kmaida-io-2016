# reStart-angular2

This is a spiritual successor to [reStart-angular](https://github.com/kmaida/reStart-angular). This is a responsive (mohbile first) boilerplate single page app in Angular 2(+).

It includes basic features to get a scalable single page application started.

## Style

* single responsibility
* Angular 2 is modular and encapsulated by default
* uses [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) + [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) rules provided by [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) to adhere to the Style Guide
* for more on style, see the [Angular 2 Style Guide](https://angular.io/styleguide)

## Features

* responsive features with matchmedia and subscription (see [angular2-mediacheck](https://github.com/kmaida/angular2-mediacheck) for documentation)
* SCSS (global and components)
* simple loading states
* sample API HTTP call using observable
* error handling
* off-canvas navigation
* filter service
* example services and components
* Bootstrap 4-alpha

## Dependencies

**Note:** I will try to keep this project up to date with the latest Angular CLI releases. However, if you find that the project's CLI version does not match your global version, you can [update the CLI by following the instructions here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#updating-angular-cli).
